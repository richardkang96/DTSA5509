# DTSA 5509
This repo includes the Jupyter Notebook and link to my video presentation on YouTube for my final project of my Supervised Learning course in the Master of Science in Data Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder. The project aimed to find the best model to classify whether someone has breast cancer or not based on relevant features about the breasts.
